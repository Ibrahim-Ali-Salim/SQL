# AdventureWorks

The AdventureWorks databases are sample databases that were originally published by Microsoft to show how to design a SQL Server database using SQL Server 2008. AdventureWorks is the OLTP sample, and AdventureWorksDW is the data warehouse sample.

Database design has progressed since AdventureWorks was first published. For a sample database leveraging more recent features of SQL Server, see [WideWorldImporters](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/wide-world-importers).
